# a basic docker-compose.yml file for my local WordPress installs

## what

a starting point for local WordPress installs.

runs the latest WP version by default and links wp-content directory to a local version - in there is where you can add project code or create a git repo etc.

Requires our [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/sleepingkiwi/nginx-proxy-docker) container to be running for the ssl functionality etc.

## usage

- put it in to a directory
- run `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` (`docker-compose stop` to stop that one)
- run `docker-compose down` to clean up everything that hasn't been saved to a volume specified in `docker-compose.yml`

See below for specifics

## Set unique ports

If you are running lots of these images then the ports for phpmyadmin on localhost will conflict so it makes sense to keep them separate. You can update `docker-compose.yml`, specifically the `ports:` sections to ensure there are no conflicts!

## local domain name and ssl certs for dev

### set up a local domain for development

``` bash
# on local machine (not the Docker Image)
sudo nano /etc/hosts
# add line like:
# 127.0.0.1 example-site.local
```

Now you also need to add your local URL under VIRTUAL_HOST: for the WordPress image. Replace `example-site.local` with the name you just added to /etc/hosts

Now if you run docker-compose up (and the proxy is running) you should be able to access your image (when it's running) on `http://example-site.local`

### Set up an ssl cert for that local domain

> If this is the first time setting up a cert:

#### Set up a local Cerificate Authority (CA)

_You only need to do this step once_ - if you already have one then you don't need another for each site.

- install `mkcert`
  - on macos that's `brew install mkcert` and `brew install nss`
- run `mkcert -install`

> If yoy already have a local CA set up:

#### Make self signed SSL certs for your local domain and give them to local proxy

These need to go into the `./certs` directory at the root of your local [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/sleepingkiwi/nginx-proxy-docker) (should be `~/dev/nginx-proxy/certs`)

``` bash
# cd into the /certs dir at the root of the nginx-proxy dir (should be ~/dev/nginx-proxy/certs)
mkcert -cert-file example-site.local.crt -key-file example-site.local.key example-site.local
```

## permissions

on first run you might get errors trying to install new plugins etc.

if you do you can run the following commands.

> If you need to find the container name use `docker ps` whilst it's running

``` bash
# whilst the container is running
docker exec -it <wordpress-container-name> bash

# create missing dirs and give yourself some rights
mkdir /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins
mkdir /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
find /var/www/ -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;
find /var/www/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

# make the shared dir/s editable on host system
# ðŸ¤¡ pls don't deploy this - it's for local use...
find /var/www/html/wp-content/ -type d -exec chmod 0777 {} \;
find /var/www/html/wp-content/ -type f -exec chmod 666 {} \;
```
