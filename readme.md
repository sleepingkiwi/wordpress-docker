## what

a starting point for local WordPress installs.

Runs the latest WP version by default and links wp-content directory to a local version - in there is where you can add project code or create a git repo etc.

## Usage

- put it in to a directory
- run `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` (`docker-compose stop` to stop that one)
- run `docker-compose down` to clean up everything that hasn't been saved to a volume specified in `docker-compose.yml`
